Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computational fluid dynamics often abbreviated (CFD) is a powerful tool
 to test theory up against experiment, and one can always verify experiments
 with numerical simulations if the experiment is set up properly.
 In order to minimize discrepancies and to keep the noise level as low as
 possible, the experimental setup and design must be performed with care
 and accuracy.
 Noise in experiments can be generated in many ways.
 Some common sources are noise due to shape and alignment which should be
 absent if the geometrical models are made with high accuracy.
 The choice of measurement method can also generate noise, both random noise
 and static.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a recent study by J.
 Kolaas, A.
 Jensen, and M.
 M.
 Mielnik, conducted at the Microfluidics Laboratory at SINTEF MiNaLab, as
 a joint project with the Hydrodynamics laboratory at University of Oslo,
 they performed experiments of fluid flow in micro-channel with special
 focus on high-accuracy geometries and also on adapting the right velocimetry
 technique and post-processing method.
 The main objective was to investigate the kinematics of the flow when changes
 were made to the geometry, and also varying the initial conditions from
 stationary to pulsative flow and the differences in the velocity and accelerati
on fields was scrutinized for different geometries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This master thesis aims to carefully run CFD simulations using FEniCS in
 an effort to reproduce these experimental data.
 Discrepancies between experiments and simulations will be an important
 topic in the light of the chosen method as well as resolution and computational
 cost.
 The simulations are performed with relatively coarse resolution in 2D,
 before attempting full 3D direct numerical simulations.

Microfluidics

\begin_layout Standard
Microfluidics is the science and technology of systems that process or manipulat
e minuscule amounts of fluids, typically between

.
 The science of it as in the study of the behavior of fluids in micro-channels,
 and the technology as the manufacturing of microfluidics devices such as
 
\emph on
lab on a chip.

\emph default
 In order to be considered as microfluidics, at least one dimension of the
 channel must be of the order of ten to hundreds of micrometers (
\begin_inset Formula $1\mu\textrm{m}=1.0\cdot10^{-6}\textrm{m}$
\end_inset

) .
 Being a multidisciplinary field intersecting engineering, physics, chemistry,
 biochemistry, nanotechnology, and biotechnology, microfluidics has a wide
 and important range of applications.
 As a technology, microfluidic offers many advantages and useful capabilities;
 the ability to use small samples and reagents, low cost, short analysis
 time, small footprints, and capable to carry out separation and detection
 with high resolution and sensitivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A microfluidic chip consists of a network of micro-channels mostly etched
 or molded into a material, typically glass, silicon or polymer such as
 PDMS (PolyDiMethylSiloxane) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The microfluidic chip is connected by inputs where the fluids are injected
 in, and carried through the micro-channels and eventually out of the chip.
 This allows one to achieve desired functions like; mixing of fluids, pumping,
 redirecting and/or allow chemical reactions.

 This allows one to achieve desired functions like; mixing of fluids, pumping,

 to the outside by inputs and outputs pierced through the chip in a network

 It is through these channels that the liquids (or gas) are injected and
 removed from the microfluidic chip (through tubing, syringe adapters or
 even free holes in the chip).

Nowadays, lots of researchers use PDMS since it is easier to use and faster

 It allows researchers to rapidly build a prototype and test their applications/

Microfluidics technology offers numerous of useful capabilities: the ability
 to use tiny quantities of samples and reagents, and to carry out separations
 and detections with high resolutions and sensitivity; low cost; short times
 for analysis and small footprints for the analytical devices.
 Microfluidics exploit both its most obvious characteristic - small size
 - and less obvious characteristics of fluids in micro-channels, such as
 laminar flow.
 It offers fundamentally new capabilities in the control of concentrations
 of molecules in space and time.

Microfluidics: History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The field of microfluidics can be divided in four major parental categories;
 
\emph on
molecular analysis
\emph default
, 
\emph on
biodefence
\emph default
, 
\emph on
molecular biology
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
microelectronics

.
 This section will give a brief history of microfluidics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The birth of transistors in the 50's made in blocks of semiconductors would
 gradually replace the lamps previously used in the manufacture of electronic
 devices (radio, computer).
 Initially, this technology was developed to manufacture microprocessors
 and to miniaturize transistors, would later make it possible to produce
 microscopic channels and integrate them on chips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 60's the development of technologies such as photolithography emerged
 and revolutionized the miniaturization and integration of transistors on
 semiconductor wafers, mainly of silicon.
 The Apollo space research with an astronomical budget of $25 billion, gave
 opportunity to fund research program on the miniaturization of computers
 which would later lead to the production of the first integrated circuit
 and with them the first microprocessors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the late 1970's a group of researchers at Stanford University led by
 Terry, Jerman and Angell , built a miniature gas analysis system based
 on the principles of gas chromatography.
 The major components was fabricated in silicon using photolithography and
 chemical etching techniques, which allowed at that time, size reductions
 of nearly three orders of magnitude compared to conventional laboratory
 instruments.
 Although, originally developed for chromatograph and expected for applications
 in the areas of portable ambient air quality monitors, implanted biological
 experiments and planetary probes, this would later turn out to be the birth
 of a new multidisciplinary field referred to as 
\emph on
microfluidics,
\emph default
 which would later intersect fields such as engineering, physics, chemistry,
 biochemistry, nanotechnology, and biotechnology 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 These techniques in combination with the power of the laser in optical
 detection enabled to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity and high resolutio
n applying very small amounts of samples or reagents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next major motivational development in microfluidics emerged after the
 cold war.
 Due to the development of chemical and biological weapons, the US Defense
 Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) would counter these threats by
 funding and supporting a series of programs with the main target at developing
 microfluidic systems designed to serve as detectors for these chemical
 and biological threats.
 These programs were the main source for the rapid growth of academic microfluid
ic technology.
 Later on in the 80's a new type of device emerged called 
\emph on
Micro Electro Mechanical Systems
\emph default
 or MEMS.
 This was based on silicon etching procedures developed for microelectronics
 industry and made it possible to manufacture the first device containing
 movable micro-elements integrated on a silicon wafer, giving rise to applicatio
ns in the fields of pressure sensors and printer heads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 80's and 90's, the explosion in genomics led to the third major developme
nt in microfluidics from the field of molecular biology and chemistry.
 One of the most significant contribution in the development of microfluidics
 came from the need for controlling the movement of liquids in micro-channels.
 Many researchers started to investigated in the applications of MEMS and
 started to develop laboratories on a chip which would enable the integration
 of almost all diagnostic operations performed in a hospital on a single
 microfluidic chip.
 The majority of microfluidic devices were still made of silicon or glass
 which required the heavy infrastructure of the microelectronics industry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The forth main contribution was from the field of microelectronics.
 Starting millennium, technologies based on molding micro-channels in polymers
 such as PDMS grew gradually and started to replace microfluidic devices
 made of silicon or glass.
 Cost and production time of these decreased and enabled a large number
 of laboratories to conduct researches in microfluidics.
 For biological sample analysis, microfluidic devices made on silicon or
 glass appears to be unsuitable or inappropriate.
 Especially, silicon is expensive.
 It also is opaque to UV and visible light, making it useless for conventional
 optical methods of detection.
 Neither glass or silicon has all the required properties for work with
 living mammalian cells, in particular, the permeability to gases is required.
 Many exploratory microfluidics research has been done with polymer, mainly
 PDMS, which has distinct properties from those of silicone

\begin_layout Standard
Thousands of researchers are today working with microfluidics to extend
 its application fields, particularly towards biomedicine, biology and chemistry.
 Two especially important contributions in the fabrication process of microfluid
ic devices are soft lithography in PDMS, and pneumatically activated , pumps,
 valves and mixers based on soft-lithographic procedures.
 These method have shortened the fabrication process of prototypes dramatically.
 In particular, quakeâ€™s pneumatic valves has been important as they have
 made it possible to design and examine complicated devices, which in turn
 made opened up a number of areas of applications.
 With new fabrication methods, microfluidics has revealed some fundamental
 differences between fluid flow in large channels and those in micro-channels.
 The most important differences are are seen in turbulence.
 In macro scale flow, fluids mix convectively, for example milk stirred
 in coffee, which illustrates that inertia is often more important then
 viscosity.
 However, when water is used as fluid in micro-channels the opposite appears
 to be true; fluids does not mix convectively.
 In fact, when to fluids streams together in micro-channels, they flow in
 a parallel stream, turbulence and eddies are absent.
 The only mixing is due to molecular diffusion across the interface between
 those fluids.
 One particularly important parameter in the study of fluid flow is the
 Reynolds number.
 This number represents the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and
 gives an indication of whether a flow is laminar or turbulent.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Microfluidics: Applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nowadays there are many methods of fabrication and a wide range of components
 making it possible to apply microfluidic systems to the resolution of problems
 instead of just demonstrate the principles.
 The most developed application in microfluidics is probably the screen
 conditions or protein crystallization such as composition, cosolvents,
 pH, ionic strength and concentration.
 These procedures allows to screen large numbers of conditions, like separate
 nucleation, the growth and conservation of crystals.
 Other laboratory applications include separations linked to mass spectroscopy,
 bioanalysis examination, manipulation of samples consisting of a single
 cell or a single molecule , high-throughput screening in drug development,
 and synthesis of F-labelled organic compounds for positron emission tomography.
 The manipulation of multiphase flows is another strength of microfluidic
 systems.
 They enable the generation and manipulation of mono-disperse bubbles, (Fig.
 3) or droplets34â€“37 of a dispersed gas or liquid phase in a continuous
 liquid stream; these dispersions suggest new routes to the production of
 polymer particles, emulsions and foams.

Microfluidics: The Future 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a branch of a more general class called
 Quantitative Imaging (QI), which is an optically based measurement technique
 applied in experimental fluid mechanics.
 Quantitative Imaging techniques are basically analysis of digital imaging
 via softwares and are based on the principles of pattern matching.
 QI enables one to capture the 
\emph on
whole field 
\emph default
properties e.g the velocity field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)$
\end_inset

, the vorticity field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\mathbf{\omega}}(\mathbf{x},t)$
\end_inset

, the Reynolds stress field 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{u'v'w'}$
\end_inset

.
 Qi techniques can be divided into three distinct and fundamentally different
 types; 1.
 Flow seeded with discrete particles - mainly used for velocity determination.
 2.
 Flow seeded with tracers, like fluorescent dye - to determine the scalar
 field properties like concentration or temperature.
 3.
 Unseeded flow - to capture the difference in density, but also to determine
 the scalar field properties.
 In the following, some general classes of QI techniques will be briefly
 presented.
 Non intrusive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Particle Streak Velocimetry
\emph default
 (PSV): This class of techniques aims to capture the particle streaks as
 a result, where the exposure time of the image is long relative to the
 time a particle occupies a point in space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Laser Speckle Velocimetry
\emph default
 (LSV): The density of seeding is so high that a captured image mostly overlaps
 and interferes with the particle images, which results in a speckle field
 or a intensity texture.
 By correlation of the speckle pattern in a small subregion with another
 subregion, the velocity field is then extracted, either with optical methods
 - Young's fringe analysis or digitally - auto/cross correlation analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Particle Image Velocimetry 
\emph default
(PIV): Now the seeding density is moderate such that the distance between
 neighbor particles are between few to ten times the particle diameter.
 This makes sure that all small subregions have many distinct discretely
 imaged particles within them and relatively few particle images overlaps.
 There are many ways to extract the velocity field, but the most common
 ways are digitally by auto/cross correlation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Particle Tracking Velocimetry 
\emph default
(PTV): In this general class of technique the seeding density is so low
 that the particle images are predominantly non-overlapping or interfering.
 By tracking the motions of individual particles over a known time, the
 velocity can be extracted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many other names for particle based techniques which fall into
 two broad classes, PIV and PTV, each with its own distinct different developmen
t path: Pulsed Light Velocimetry (PLV), Particle Image Displacement Velocimetry
 (PIDV), Particle Displacement Velocimetry (PDV), Digital Particle image
 Velocimetry (DPIV), Digital Particle Tracking Velocimetry (DPTV), Correlation
 Image Velocimetry (CIV), Spatial Correlation Velocimetry (SCV) and Large-Scale
 Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV).
 For three dimensional QI techniques there are four fundamental approaches:
 
\emph on
Holographic
\emph default
 techniques, 
\emph on
Stereoscopic imaging
\emph default
 with multiple cameras, 
\emph on
Depth-Of-Field
\emph default
 (DOF) with a single camera, and scanning a light sheet through a volume.
 The basic principle to all particle based techniques is that the instantaneous
 velocity field is measured by recording the position of images produced
 by small tracer particles, suspended in the fluid, at successive instants
 in time.

Hereafter the focus will be on PIV.
 With PIV, the flow is seeded with appropriately sized particles and a strong
 light source typically laser is used to illuminate the particles over a
 quasi two-dimensional light sheet with equally spaced grids.
 Thereafter, a digital camera that is connected to a computer, collects
 the images as the particles pass the light sheet.
 There are many ways to collect the mean displacements of the particles,
 which falls under one of two categories; single exposure of multiple images
 or multiple exposure of a single image.
 In single exposure multiple images(<--sjekk), the fundamental technique
 to extract information is done by crosscorrelation, while multi-exposed
 single image uses autocorrelation.

Since crosscorrelation is more accurate and also more straightforward, the
 discussion will be restricted on PIV based on crosscorrelation of image
 pair, meaning that crosscorrelation analysis will be applied to two consecutive
 images.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that a pair of images is captured, the second picture is collected
 in a known time lag 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t=t_{n}-t_{n-1}$
\end_inset

, then a straight forward approach to crosscorrelation analysis is to define
 a squared sub-window, each side with length 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2^{n}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is an integer.
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is typically taken as a power of two, which enables to determine the crosscorre
lation in the frequency domain via the fast Fourier transform (FFT).
 If we furthermore assume that the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $N=32$
\end_inset

, with an image size of 
\begin_inset Formula $NR\times NC$
\end_inset

 pixels, where 
\begin_inset Formula $NR\times NC$
\end_inset

 being the number of rows and columns in the digital image.
 Each image pair is divided into non-overlapping 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N$
\end_inset

 sub-windows, then, applying the two-dimensional crosscorrelation of each
 sub-window, where the crosscorrelation function is defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R(s,t)=\frac{1}{N^{2}}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}F_{I,J}^{'}(i,j)F_{I,J}^{''}(i+s,j+t)\label{eq:CrosscorrelationFunction}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{'}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{''}$
\end_inset

 is the first and second image of the image pair, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is the cyclic crosscorrelation between sub-window 
\begin_inset Formula $I,J$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

 is the pixel location within the sub-window 
\begin_inset Formula $I,J$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s,t$
\end_inset

 being the 
\begin_inset Formula $2D$
\end_inset

 cyclic lag where the crosscorrelation is being computed.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is often computed in the spectral domain, equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) can be rewritten as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 In 1977, three groups of researchers Barker & Fourney (1977), Dudderar
 & Simpkins (1977) and Grousson & Mallick (1977), independently achieved
 to make such measurements by the method of Laser Speckle Velocimetry (LSV),
 which was at that time originally developed for application in the field
 of solid mechanics.
 They demonstrated how to measure the fluid velocity field by measuring
 the parabolic velocity profile for a laminar flow in a tube, by using a
 double exposure photographs in combination with laser illuminated planar
 light sheet and interrogation by forming Young's interference fringes from
 multiple pairs of displaced laser speckles in small interrogation spots
 on the specklegrams.
 Between 1979-1983, a young phd student (Meynart) showed many practical
 applications in both laminar and turbulent fluid flows by the method of
 LSV.
 This gained strong interest from the fluid mechanics community.

In 1984, the first important explicit recognition of particle images was
 made in two contemporaneous papers by Pickering & Halliwell (1984) and
 Adrian (1984) who argued that by illuminating fluid flows by light sheet
 would rarely if ever produce speckle patterns in the image plane.
 The image plane would instead have images of individual particles.
 This was the first time the term PIV was proposed in the literature with
 the purpose to distinguish it of operation method from LSV.
 A simple criterion was made to distinguish the occurrence of the one mode
 or the other by defining a dimensionless parameter called the source density,
 which basically is mean number of particles in a volume of resolution and
 one can express the number of overlapping images in the image plane in
 terms of it.
 Many turbulence researchers realized the promising ability PIV offered
 to study the structure of turbulent flows and this consequently strongly
 influenced in which direction this method would be developed.
 Turbulence is characterized by its random chaotic motion making it impossible
 do determine the direction of the flow.
 Also the velocities and accelerations are high which implies to use very
 small particles typically few microns in diameter, in order to be able
 to follow these fluctuating acceleration.
 The tiny light scattering cross section of these particles suggest the
 use of high intensity illumination.
 To capture images of very fine particles without blurring required short
 exposure time and the use of high intensity pulsed laser with a light sheet
 illuminating particles with diameter ranging from few microns in gases
 to tens of microns in liquids.
 The energy needed to illuminate and to produce clear images of fine particles
 was a major issue in PIV.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From Laser Doppler Velocimetry, researchers had a good understanding of
 light scattering and appropriate particle sizes needed to follow turbulent
 flows.
 Using Mie scattering theory one could show that the energy pulsed lasers
 generated would was enough to obtain good photographic images from particles
 wit a few microns in in air and 
\begin_inset Formula $10-30\mu m$
\end_inset

 particles in water.
 This led to the next major step in PIV technique, which was to use high-resolut
ion (300 line/mm) film with double-pulsed solid-state lasers.
 This would produce excellent double exposure photos of particles .
 The first users of Nd:Yag was in 1986 (Kompenhans & Reichmuth ).
 Nd:Yag lasers became widely available came compactly with dual oscillator
 packages and self-contained cooling supplies, which became essential in
 all PIV systems.

The use of autocorrelation of double exposure images of many particles in
 a small interrogation spots appeared in two papers Sutton et al.
 1983, Adrian & Yao 1984.
 This was to replace measuring the spacing and orientation of Youngâ€™s fringes
 that form from illuminating such spots.
 Both approaches was related by Fourier transform, with the measurement
 based on the sharp signal peak in the correlation plane.
 The idea was to divide the entire image into usually overlapping interrogation
 spots, and interrogate the particle images in each spot to extract the
 mean mean displacement within each interrogation cell, consisting of interrogat
ion spot area 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{I}$
\end_inset

 and the thickness of the light sheet 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z_{0}$
\end_inset

 .Analysis of the autocorrelation method (Keane & Adrian 1992) led to a new
 definition regarding a second dimensionless number, called the image density.

The greatest challenge of PIV in the first decade was the interrogation
 of images due to the lack of computer power available.
 A typical computer in many fluid laboratories had 128 KB of RAM and 30
 MB hard drive which is the data in a RAM space at the same minimum file
 size used by a current word processor.
 To perform a 2D Fourier transform or autocorrelation was practically impossible
 with those computers.
 One of the most important evolution in the PIV technique was the move from
 photographic recordings to video recordings in the early 90's.
 This improved the usability profoundly and consequently gained the popularity
 of PIV.
 It was then clear that digital imaging would be the future standard of
 PIV at some point in.
 The next major development was in 1994 when a group of researchers Lorenzo
 et al.
 convinced Kodak to develop interline transfer cameras that could record
 two rapidly successive pictures by transferring the first picture recorded
 by each pixel on to an on-chip storage well, and then record a.
 These new cameras enabled three particularly important improvements.
 Firstly, crosscorrelation could not be conveniently implemented without
 these new cameras, and theoretically it was known that crosscorrelation
 of images recorded separately of the first and second exposures was superior
 to the autocorrelation of double exposures (Keane and Adrian 1992).
 Second, with the crosscorrelation cameras, the need of image shifting was
 eliminated because the order of the exposures automatically determined
 the direction of the flow.
 Third and most important was the elimination of small displacement image
 overlap which made it possible for a wide dynamical range.
 These cameras had a major influence in the development of PIV.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From 1993-2000 many papers on PIV where published all with the goal of extending
 interrogation methods and high image density.
 At the same time many development occurred on the optical side.
 Stereographic imaging was used early to make photogrammetric measurements
 by tracking particles in volumes Guezennec et al.
 1994, Dracos et al.
 1993, Maas et al.
 1993, Kasagi & Nishino 1993.
 Stereographic PIV solves the issue of perspective error, it also gives
 the third velocity component, and it has proven to be a practical generalizatio
n of monoscopic PIV.
 A 3D photogrammetric measurement yields around 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{4}$
\end_inset

 vectors in a cubic volume, corresponding to 20 vector sample points per
 side.
 After some post processing, the PIV measurement is only equivalent to sampling
 on a regular 
\begin_inset Formula $7\times7\times7$
\end_inset

 grid, which is sufficient only for the study of laminar or two phase flow,
 but not good enough for turbulence.
 These limitation stimulated many efforts to make volumetric PIV measurement
 from holographic recording.
 Holographic recording enables to isolate one plane at a time, and thus
 eliminate the particle image overlap problem.
 Various research groups (Meng & Hussain 1991, Barnhart et al.
 1994; Royer 1997; Trolinger et al.
 1997, suggested that the upwards of 106 regularly spaced vectors can be
 obtained using off-axis recording, which corresponds to a regular grid
 of about 
\begin_inset Formula $100\times100\times100$
\end_inset

, making it as good as in planar PIV.
 However, the holographic approach is not widely used mainly because it
 is expensive, it also requires considerable skills in operation, and third
 it is impossible to realistically record enough holograms to give stable
 turbulence statistics.
 This would change significantly if digital optical recording media became
 available with sufficient resolution and sensitivity.
 Current digital cameras are adequate for very small volume, in particular
 microscopic inline holography has shown considerable promise (Jian et al.
 2003).
 Application of PIV to micro-scale flows Santiago et al.
 1998 reduced the typical PIV measurement volume from 1 mm to 10 microns
 and less.
 This is a remarkable increase of two-orders of magnitude in spatial resolution
 which is achieved at the cost of reduction of the field-of-view by a correspond
ing amount, and provides a useful new tool for microfluidics.

One of the main advantage with this type of etching technique is the extreme
 precision in the geometrical model i.e the width and the depth of the channel
 geometry, with a deviation in the channel width being less than 0.3 Î¼m.
 Another advantage is that there is no restriction on how to structure the
 channel.
 The geometry can be etched with complicated branching patterns and total
 randomness, which could be handy when for example in the study of flows
 in complex tube/pipe bundles.

The geometries chosen herein are motivated by expanded bifurcations that
 occur in biomedical flow, with aneurysms.
 The width of the channels are somewhat smaller compared to the main arteries
 forming the circle of Willis.
 However, Kamath [11] argues that also smaller arteries can be found.
 The right and left posterior communicating artery and anterior communicating
 artery can have diameter down to 0.4 mm.
 Since the present study is flow in channels and not tubes, this is an attempt
 to study local flow features around sharp edges and how stable the flow
 will be with expansion of a bifurcation.
 Focus will be on separation in stationary and pulsative flow with different
 flow rates.

 The pressure taps are the small outlets from the channels, and the flow
 was driven by a programable syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus PHD 2200).
 This pump was not powerful enough to create a periodic time-dependent flow
 within the recording length of the camera.
 Alternatively, two valves were used to either send or bypass the flow through
 the bifurcation, where both outlets were connected through a confluence
 to ensure equal pressure condition on the outlets before ending in a pipe
 above a sink (atmospheric pressure condition).

Particle Tracking 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) is an ideal technique for studying the
 local and particle accelerations for time-dependent flow in channels with
 expanded bifurcation.
 The high speed digital camera is powerful enough for 1000 fps at full resolutio
n, but this is only sufficient for measuring the lowest flow rate.
 To cover all flow rates, a possible remedy is to physically scale the channel
 with several versions of the geometry ranging the width of the channel
 from 0.4â€“4mm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental idea in PTV is to suspend particles in a fluid, then measure
 the displacement of the particles to obtain an indirect measurement of
 the fluid flow, with the assumption that the particles will follow the
 fluid.
 By taking two (or more) images of the flow at a given time interval
\begin_inset Formula $Î”t$
\end_inset

, one can measure the particle displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $Î”x$
\end_inset

 and thus estimate the velocity of the particle 
\begin_inset Formula $Î”u=Î”x/Î”t$
\end_inset

, and consequently the fluid velocity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main difference between regular PTV and 
\begin_inset Formula $Î¼$
\end_inset

PTV is a difference in scale.
 Another consideration is the illumination of the particles, where in regular
 PTV the particles are illuminated using a light sheet, while at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

-scale illuminating a light sheet usually not possible and therefore volume
 illumination is used instead, which results in increased background noise
 and weakens the quality of 
\begin_inset Formula $Î¼$
\end_inset

PIV .
 Contrary to PIV, PTV has the ability to detect and choose particles based
 on their properties like size and intensity, which removes the effect from
 large and dim particles far from the focal plane.
 Due to Lagrangian nature of each particles, when measuring a pulsative
 flow , the velocity and acceleration are easily found for each particle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The position of each particle is 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\xi}(\boldsymbol{x},t)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\xi}$
\end_inset

 is the initial position and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is the time.
 The Eulerian velocity field can be obtained from spatially averaged time-resolv
ed PTV (SATPTV).
 However, Kolaas et.al used an ensemble-average of the position of particles
 by the method of moving least squares, also referred as local polynomial
 regression.
 
\end_layout

\[
\overline{\boldsymbol{\xi}(\boldsymbol{x},t)}=e_{1}^{T}(P^{T}WP)^{-1}P^{T}\boldsymbol{x}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is the multivariate Vandermonde matrix for a shifted power basis and 
\begin_inset Formula $W$

 is a weighting function.
 To estimate the particle velocity and the acceleration a weighted least
 squares problem is solved for each evaluation point and the fitted local
 polynomial is then differentiated.
 The velocity

\overline{\boldsymbol{a}(\boldsymbol{x},t)}=\frac{\text{\partial}\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}+\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u}=\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}\left(\overline{\boldsymbol{x}(\boldsymbol{\xi},t)}\right)

The use of ensemble averaging invokes consideration of variance and bias
 error , where the bias error is due to signal smoothing which can be large
 if the signal is over-smoothed.
 There is a weighing between bias (resolution) and variance (accuracy).
 By selecting the right sub-window size these errors can be minimized .
 Other important considerations for multivariate estimation is to balance
 accuracy vs.
 computational cost, which for MLS can be done by applying a weighting function
 with compact support and building a kd-tree, which basically is a space-partiti
oning data structure for organizing points in a

 as the hydraulic diameter of the inlet channel given by

With the inlet length of

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ArtStandDev"

\end_inset

, which resulted in a estimate of 4.1% (95% confidence) for an instant moment
 in the time-resolved flow.
 The random error was higher where particles entered at the inlet and the
 outlet of the field of view (FOV) and due to the background noise the error
 was higher along the edges of the geometry.
 Also, because of a small crease in the sealing film, there was registered
 higher error in the small outlet which could be explained by the fact that
 the particle track loses information of the particle position when it passes
 under the crease.
 A similar analysis made on the local and particle acceleration showed that
 the absolute error estimate for the accelerations is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $6.3\cdot10^{3}\mu m/s^{2}$
\end_inset

 with a 95% confidence.
 Theoretically, the local acceleration 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial u/\partial t=0$
\end_inset

, suggesting that a relative estimate would not be informative.

\begin_layout Standard
Poiseuille flow for a square duct was used to check and compare the error
 in the velocity measurement for the flow upstream from the bifurcation,
 since the Poiseuille flow would include systematic errors.
 The stationary measurement contained 
\begin_inset Formula $17$
\end_inset

 layers of the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-axis, with each layer consisting of 400 frames taken at 1000 fps, which
 where selected by stepping the focus using the motorized microscope.
 The discrepancy was found to be 
\begin_inset Formula $(u_{therory}-u)_{rms}/u_{max}=2.43\text{\%}$
\end_inset

 which was of the same order as the accuracy of the pump (1%) (see fig.

\begin_inset Formula $d_{s}$

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

 is the wave number of light and 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

-number of the lens or commonly called the focal ratio.
 Since this theory is originally developed for air, one can account for
 the light passing through different media.
 By assuming paraxial approximation, then the 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

-number can be modified by 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{w}\approx f_{a}\frac{n_{a}}{n_{w}}$
\end_inset

 , where 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{w}$
\end_inset

 are the index of refraction for air and water, respectively.
 This is only valid when the thickness of sealing film and depth of channel
 is small compared to the object distance.
 Other sources of error include the distribution of particle diameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{std}(dp)/dp=5\%$
\end_inset

 , and if the particles are illuminated by a spectrum rather instead of
 a single wavelength may cause some chromatic aberration.
 Since the sign of the z-position of the particle is missing, it is not
 possible to calculate the first moment of the velocity component 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-direction , instead the estimation of the second moment can be done by
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\mid z\mid\right)^{2}=\left(\textrm{sign}(z)\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}\right)=w^{2}
\]

\end_inset

using the definition of variance 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\textrm{var}(w)=E(w^{2})-E(w)^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 the estimates on the mean and std of the out-of-plane velocity can be given:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0\leq E(w)\leq\sqrt{E(w^{2})}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0\leq\textrm{std}(w)\leq\sqrt{E(w^{2})}
\]

\end_inset

To determine the particle size one can assume that the particle image can
 be approximated by a Gaussian distribution 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
I=I_{bg}+I_{0}\exp(-4\beta^{2}\frac{(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_{0})^{T}(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_{0})}{d_{e}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

The diameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{e}$
\end_inset

, is then defined at the contour line 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(-\beta^{2})$
\end_inset

 using a constrained non-linear least square fit.
 Because of the time-continuous exposure, the particles will be smeared
 along the particle tracks, which can be adjusted by introducing a more
 general Gaussian distribution 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
I=I_{bg}+I_{0}\exp(-4\beta^{2}(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_{0})^{T}D^{-1}(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_{0})
\]

\end_inset

The diameter 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 was taken as the smallest eigenvalue of
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
 To assure that 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is positive definite, elements of the Cholesky factorization of 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 are used as parameters in the minimization rather then the elements in
 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
 By this theory the following estimation can be given 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0\leq E(w)\leq\sqrt{E(w^{2})}\sim\frac{1}{16}\sqrt{U^{2}+V^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0\leq\textrm{std}(w)\leq\sqrt{E(w^{2})}\sim3.3\sqrt{u^{2}+v^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The estimated out-of-plane component did not seemed to depend on the flow
 rate, instead it appeared to be constant over the FOV, indicating that
 the physical component can be constant or the estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $E(w^{2})$
\end_inset

 is limited by the accuracy of the algorithm and then the physical quantities
 are likely to be smaller than the estimate.
 Even if we do not take this into account, the estimate is much closer to
 the fluctuations than the mean of the other components, hence the out-of-plane
 is likely to be small or zero.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the Lagrangian information the full acceleration field can be calculated.
 This is not so easy with PIV where only the local acceleration is estimated
 from two subsequent velocity fields.
 The accelerations is important for quantifying the flow and also to determine
 the pressure and forces acting at the walls.
 In numerical simulations the dynamics of the flow can be difficult to calculate
 due to the high spatial and temporal resolution needed.

where the velocity vector is 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x},t)$
\end_inset

, the constant fluid density is incorporated in the pressure is 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\boldsymbol{x},t)$
\end_inset

 , the kinematic viscosity 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, the concentration of species 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 with the corresponding diffusivity 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 and any volumetric or gravitational forces like buoyancy are denoted as
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x},t)$
\end_inset

.
 Other scalar sources like the chemical reaction rate is 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\alpha}(\boldsymbol{c})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{c}(\boldsymbol{x},t)$
\end_inset

 is the vector of concentration of all species.
 The velocity and the pressure are solved separately with the fractional
 step method (NSfracStep.py).
 Optionally, Oasis has another method where the velocity and the pressure
 are solved simultaneously through a coupled solver (NSCoupled.py).
 In the fractional step method, the velocity vector are divided into its
 components 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}$
\end_inset

 which will increase the efficiency of the constructed solver.
 The temporal domain 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in[0,T]$
\end_inset

 is uniformly distributed with constant time step 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t=t^{n}-t^{n-1}$

The most common approach in discretizing a partial differential equation
 in combination with FEM is to discretize the spatial terms with FEM and
 the temporal terms with finite difference method FDM.
 The local acceleration is discretized by the backward Euler method, while
 the convective and the source term is discretized by the midpoint method.
 Thus, the generic fractional step algorithm goes as follows 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{u^{I}-u^{n-1}}{\Delta t}+B_{k}^{n-\frac{1}{2}}=-\nabla_{k}p^{*}+\nu\nabla_{k}^{2}\tilde{u}_{k}+f^{n-\frac{1}{2}}\qquad\textrm{for}\qquad k=1,\ldots,d\label{eq:Oasis4}

\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}^{n}$

\begin_inset Formula $\phi=p^{n-\frac{1}{2}}-p*$

\begin_inset Formula $p*$
\end_inset

 The velocity and the pressure are solved for on the next time step 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}^{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{n-\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

, furthermore the tentative velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{n}^{I}$
\end_inset

 is solved as unknown.
 The viscous term is discretized by a semi implicit Crankâ€“Nicolson interpolated
 velocity component to avoid strict time step restrictions.
 
\begin_inset Formula
